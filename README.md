Biomimetics For Applications in 3D Printed Greenhouses

## About
This project withholds the design and investigation of 3D printed greenhouses inspired by biological structures. This accomplished through the process of biomimicry defined as the inspiration of structural design taken from nature to optimise said structure. Therefore, within this thesis paper, the biomimetic approach is aimed to optimise a greenhouse resistance to both wind and gravitational loadings The biological structure that has been used as inspiration to allow for structural optimisation is honeycombs intertwined and modelled to the exterior of the greenhouse geodesic dome. 

The 3D printed element is concentrating on the structural aspect of greenhouses. Furthermore, evaluation of structural effectiveness is conducted utilizing finite element analysis method. Final part of this thesis is also to 3D print a scale model for potential purposes of physical testing.
